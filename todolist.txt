Baseball game to do list:

fix force-out issue (current):
	runner who just got to first gets called out if there is a runner headed to 2nd.

second baseman doesn't always run to second base:
	sometimes he just sits there and waits.




eventually:

create a screen for pitching/hitting, have that send ball data to fielding view.
